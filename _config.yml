  Hi, my name is Martin and I'm a Senior iOS Developer.

  Aside from making iPhone Apps, I also have experience regarding application security as well as backend development.

  From small scale projects up to very large applications, I'm able to handle various type of problematics and I'm a very quick learner.

  My experience through the years made me work in teams or on my own, from an office or a remote location.

  I'm currently in Paris, France.
